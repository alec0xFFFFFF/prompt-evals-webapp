# Welcome to Remix + Vite!

ðŸ“– See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) for details on supported features.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`


## ROADMAP
- to json in validation i.e. format and fields
- add messages and message/conversation generation
- prompt and messages/conversation history construction
- other models
- templates for evaluation
- generate a conversation to test the prompt against
- show updates on this
- fix run in parallel
- persistence
- keep track of all calls/tokens
